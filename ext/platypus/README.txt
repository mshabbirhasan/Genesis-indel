1. Requirements
===============

Platypus requires Python 2.6 or greater. It has not tested with the Python 3.X
series.


2. Installation
===============

To build Platypus, run the 'buildPlatypus.sh' script included in the distribution:

cd Platypus_X.X.X
./buildPlatypus.sh

and this will compile all the required libraries. Platypus can then be run from the Platypus_X.X.X
directory as follows:


3. Running Platypus
===================

The easiest way to run Platypus is as follows:

python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=LIST_OF_BAMS --refFile=REF.fa --output=Calls.vcf


You can see a list of all the possible input options by running the following comand:

python Platypus.py callVariants --help

However, in most cases the default parameter values should be fine, and you will only need to specify the --bamFiles
and --refFile and --output arguments. By default, if you do not specify a region or regions or interest, Platypus will
run through all the data in your BAM files. The --regions argument can be used to specify regions of interest.


3. Running in Variant-Calling Mode
==================================

The standard way of running Platypus is to use it to detect variants in one or more BAM files. Variants are detected by
comparing the BAM reads with a reference sequence. This can be done using the following command:

python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=DATA.bam --regions=chr20 --output=test.vcf --refFile=GENOME.fa

where the input BAM files, and the genome reference must be indexed using samtools, or a program that produces compatible
index files.


4. Variant calling with additional Reference calling
====================================================

Platypus can also output reference calls. When a region is well covered by reads, and there is no evidence
of variation from the reference, a 'REFCALL' block will be output. This can be useful if you want to exclude
the possibility of any variation in a specific region. Each REFCALL block comes with an associated quality score,
in the 'QUAL' column. If this is high, then there is good support for the reference sequence; if this score is low,
then there is some evidence for variation, but not enough for Platypus to make an explicit variant call.

To enable reference-calling, use the '--outputRefCalls=1' flag:

python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=DATA.bam --regions=chr20 --output=test.vcf --refFile=GENOME.fa --outputRefCalls=1


5. Running in Genotyping Mode
=============================

Platypus can take as input a compressed, indexed VCF file, and genotype the BAMs for all alleles in the compressed, indexed VCF.
To run Platypus in genotyping mode, use the following command:

python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=DATA.bam --regions=chr20 --output=test.vcf --refFile=GENOME.fa --source=INPUT.vcf.gz --minPosterior=0 --getVariantsFromBAMs=0

You must use as input a VCF that has been compressed, with bgzip, and indexed with tabix. To create this, do the following:

bgzip file.vcf # Converts file.vcf into file.vcf.gz
tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz # Creates the index file.vcf.gz.tbi


5.1 Known issues with genotyping
================================

Sometimes variants in the input VCF don't get genotypes in the output VCF. This generally only happens in complex regions, with many
variant candidates, when the particular variant is not well supported by the data, typically when there are lots of indels close together.


6. Running in Combined Genotyping/Calling Mode
==============================================

If required, Platypus can detect variants from the input BAM files, as well as using an input allele list. This can be done as
follows:

python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=DATA.bam --regions=chr20 --output=test.vcf --refFile=GENOME.fa --source=INPUT.vcf.gz

For cases 3 and 4, if you want '0/0', i.e. reference genotypes to be reported, then set the argument --minPosterior=0, and the output VCF
will then also contain records for variants candidates which were genotyped '0/0'.


7. Main command-line arguments to Platypus
==========================================

# General variant-calling arguments
--output                   # Name of output VCF file

--minGoodQualBases                    # Minimum number of bases with quality above --minBaseQual that must be present for a read to be used (default is 20).
--filterDuplicates                    # If set to 1 then Platypus will skip duplicate read-pairs based on the start and end position of both reads (default is 1).
--filterReadsWithUnmappedMates        # If set to 1, Platypus filters reads whose mates are un-mapped (default is 1).
--filterReadsWithDistantMates         # If set to 1, Platypus filters reads whose mates are mapped far away, using the IS_PROPER_PAIR flag in the BAM record. (Default is 1).
--filterReadPairsWithSmallInserts     # If set to 1, Platypus filters read-pairs with insert sizes < one read length (default is 1).


# Arguments for local assembly
--assemble                 # Set to 1 to turn on local assembly. Default is 0

# Arguments for referene calling
--outputRefCalls          # If set to 1, Platypus will output reference call blocks (default is 0).


These are not all the possible arguments. To get a complete list, run "python Platypus.py callVariants --help". But anything not listed here
should generally be left alone.


8. VCF output
=============

The VCF files output by Platypus contain a number of annotations, some of which are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.


8.1 INFO fields
===============

FR        # Estimated haplotype population frequency
TC        # Total coverage at this locus
TCR       # Total reverse strand coverage at this locus
TCF       # Total forward strand coverage at this locus
NR        # Total number of reverse reads containing this variant
NF        # Total number of forward reads containing this variant
TR        # Total number of reads containing this variant
HP        # Homopolmer run length in 20 bases either side of variant position
PP        # Posterior probability (phred scaled) that this variant segregates in the data.
SC        # Genomic sequence 10 bases either side of variant position
MMLQ      # Median minimum base quality for bases around variant. If this is low (<=10) then the variant is only supported by low-quality reads.
WS        # Start position of window in which variant was called
WE        # End position of window in which variant was called
SOURCE    # Flag to say if the variant was found by Platypus, the Assembler, or an input file
END       # End position of reference call-block. Only used for reference calling
Sb        # Pval Binomial P-value for strand bias test
MQ        # Root mean square of mapping qualities of reads at the variant position
QD        # Variant-quality/read-depth for this variant
SC        # Genomic sequence 10 bases either side of variant position
BRF       # Fraction of reads around this variant that failed filters
HapScore  # The number of haplotypes supported in the calling window
Size      # Size of reference call block. Only used for reference calling


8.2 FILTER fields
=================

strandBias     # Variant fails strand-bias filter
alleleBias     # Variant fails allele-bias filter
badReads       # Variant is supported only by low-quality reads
Q20            # Variant-call has low posterior score ( < phred-score of 20)
GOF            # Variant-call fails goodness-of-fit test
PASS           # Variant passes all filters
QD             # Ratio of variant quality to number of supporting reads is low
SC             # Sequence context surrounding variant has low complexity

For multi-allelic sites, the filter field is based on information from the best variant
call at that site, so there may be variants which fail filters at these sites. VCF does not
allow allele-specific filter values.


8.3 FORMAT fields
=================

GT   # Un-phased genotype calls
GL   # Genotype log-likelihoods (natural log) for AA,AB and BB genotypes, where A = ref and B = variant. Only applicable for bi-allelic sites
GOF  # Phred-scaled goodness-of-fit score for the genotype call
GQ   # Phred-scaled quality score for the genotype call
NR   # Number of reads covering variant position in this sample
NV   # Number of reads at variant position which support the called variant in this sample


9 Known Issues
==============

When genotyping, if there are many variants close together, then not all will be reported in the output VCF. This is only true for variants
which are not supported by the data. Variants that are well supported will have genotype calls.


10 Release History
=================

0.1.5
===== 

Released in November 2011. First stable release of Platypus

0.1.6
===== 

Released on 23 Feb 2012. Various bug-fixes and tweaks, the most significant being
the following:

- Improved output when genotyping. FILTER and INFO fields are now correctly computed
- Fixed multi-sample genotyping, which previously had an underflow error in high-coverage regions
- Fixed small bug in posterior calculation, which was sometimes slightly wrong for high-confidence calls
- Improved data-filtering for duplicate reads and broken read pairs
- Added NV and NR fields to the per-sample FORMAT columns. NV is the number of variant-supporting reads, and NR is the total number of reads covering that position
- Fixed off-by-one error in VCF parsing, by adding pysam version check
- Added experimental flag --mergeClusteredVariants for calling in divergent samples. This is not fully tested, and does slow down calling substantially.
- Numerous other small fixes and performance tweaks

0.1.7
===== 

Released on 14 March 2012.

- Fixed error caused by zero coverage in window
- Improved read filtering: pairs with small inserts no longer lead to spurious insertion calls
- Improved haplotype generation: adjacent SNP/deletion haplotypes not generated correctly
- Switched to using single sample likelihoods by default, not EM likelihoods: this fixes various
  inconsistencies between the genotype calls and likelihoods
- Fixed bug when genotyping complex regions, which lead to incorrect genotypes being assigned
- Improved window algorithm when the --mergeClusteredVariants flag is set to 1
- Removed cap on likelihoods in alignment function, to improve calling in divergent regions
- Switched off EM filtering. Now uses simple coverage filter to remove noise.
- Fixed small bug in VCF INFO computations
- Fixed bug in left-normalisation. If Platypus cannot left-normalise an indel, it reports it in the position it was originally
  seen in the BAM.
